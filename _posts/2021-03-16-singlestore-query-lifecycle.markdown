A training on the query lifecycle and plancaching at SingleStore.

While at SingleStore, I created an internal training to familiarize the new Customer Support team in India with elements of query processing. This is a portion of that training, focusing on query plancaching, which I recorded for posting publicly. In this training video, I walk through how a query plan is generated by the optimizer, how query plans are cached for reuse, and how you can view and modify this behavior, including resolution of common issues.
